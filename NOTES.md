Things worth considering changing:

- rename `also` to `and` in recipes (?)
- rename `in` because it's a reserved word (allowed in CoffeeScript though)
- automatically create directories (as in mkdir -p)
- scan only paths matching to 'in' patterns
- watch dirs for new files
- bring back the purify command
